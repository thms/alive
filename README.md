Questions for Evolution
Given current amount of DNA and level, how far can I evolve create and how many coins is that going to cost?

Total cost of dinosaur to date, in DNA and coins
Likelihood to get dinosaur to level x, given average DNA over time (based on total cost for dinosaur to date in DNA and coins)

Questions for Fighting
Which dinosaur is more like to win in a given fight?
Which team is more likely to win in a given fight?


Data needed
DNA needed to progress to next level, coins needed to progress to next level
Fusions: dna needed for one fusion for each level of rarity

DONE
Basic model that shows relationships for Hybrids
Simple render of graph for lineage of Hybrids
CRUD
Cost to get dinosaur to next level in terms of coins and DNA to collect (broken down for hybrids of what the cost is per contributor)
Cost to get dinosaur to level x
Cost to create hybrid, given current ingredients, so we can do the cheapest ones first.
